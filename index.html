      <h3><span class="blackcolor">About the class</span></h3>
      <p>Our class is full of crazy people with Pankaj being the only intelligent man. I have so much to tell about everyone, starting with Mr. Ankur Kumar who is the main haraami of our class, He looks like a bachcha but he is very Haraami from inside, He says that he is going to come to the class but he never does, this makes him far more Haraami than everybody else, okay enough about Mr. Ankur, moving onto Mr. Girwar singh who is my closest friend and a very nice person, He always completes his notebook and always ready to submit them to the teachers.</p>
      <p>We also have a Linux/Youtube premi Mr. Divyakant Bariha who's a meme man and a night owl, he's very eager to get a girlfriend and stares every girl around him. And there's a Mr Akhilesh Kumar Ratre who studies chupke-chupke all the time pretending to be online in Facebook, Fortunatly we have a notification system for every activity he does that tells us everything about him. We also have a Mr. Gopi Kishan who never studies but one night before the exam.</p>
      <p>And there's a Mr. Kush <!--Chus-->Kumar Yadav who is a Ladkibaaj, whenever you see him he's always talking with girls. We have a new boy Mr. Hemant in the class about whom I don't know much but he's a cool and friendly guy. And now Mr. Bhola prasad who's also a rooted Android phone guy I guess, which makes him a techie and he looks like John Cena. Mr. Kuntal Roy who's the favorite of every teacher don't know why, but he's always in politics with some of his bhaiyas and all making plans how to do this and this and also this. </p>
      <p>Now Mr. sidhwa ladka Rajesh Kumar who is a cow (according to his behaviour), he never interrupts between talks and is a very good listener having a low voice. And Mr. Deepak Rathore a DSLR DP guy, works at Samsung, who's always like "Bhai aisa".</p>
      <p>And now coming to "never come to the class category". Starting with Mr. Khalid Raza a gyani purush, popular in girls, speaks in a drunkard accent as far as my ears can listen, he's also a very respectful man. Moving on to Mr. Sunny Sharma, a stenographer, fighting various competetive exams trying luck and a future Army Soldier or a Patwari. And Mr. Akash Vishwakarma the casanova, never comes to the class but is a self study guy who always passes the exam. Now last of the boys section Mr. Amit Kumar Who's a one woman man, tall and that's all I know about him. </p>
      <p>In the girls section we have Miss Moti Geetanjali Rathore whom I guess to be 100KG in weight, 1080px in width and 1920px in height, please take an advice never take a picture of her unless you have a 64GB storage device. And now while writing about this girl I'm very scared as she has not permitted me to write even a single word for her, but still, Miss Bhawana Dhiwar the Topper is very sensitive like a chhuyi muyi and never speaks wrong about anyone, don't like any type of gaali and abusive words like "Ayituhc". We also have a Miss Priyanka Chopda always busy shooting for her TV show QUANTICO and because of that is unable to come to the class, Despite being busy, whenever she meets, she's always like "Tu na re". And Last but not the least Miss Pooja Sahu, <!-- AKA Dhinchak Pooja -->about whom I have no words to write, except she's a free WiFi hotspot girl.</p>
      <p>P.S.: The author has no intension to hurt anyone's feelings and even if he does what can you do <!-- Ukhaad lo --> except taking Babaji ka Thullu? OK jokes apart, where were we, hmm the author was hurting feelings... so if he do hurt anyone's feelings he's extremely sorry<!-- Ghanta --> for his foolishness<!-- intelligence -->.</p>
